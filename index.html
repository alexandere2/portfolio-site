                <p> Hello Everyone! I'm a Fourth-Year Business Honors Student studying Finance w/ Minor in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida.
                    My career aspirations are to become a Quantitative Analyst, Private Equity Analyst, or a Financial Planning Analyst. 
                    I wanted to obtain a minor in Businesss Analytics because having unique and diverse skill sets in the realm of finance such as Python, R, SAS, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL would seperate me from other financial applicants in the job market.
                </p>
